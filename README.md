# GBLI Innovation Day (12/12/2018)

Goal of this project is to implement an <a href="https://ngrx.io/">NgRx Store.</a>

## Running the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanehrler/gbli-innovation-day-2018-12-11.git
cd gbli-innovation-day-2018-12-11
npm install
ng serve
```

## Objectives

#### If this was a team effort, who was on the team?

This was a solo effort.

#### What did you do?

Implemented NgRx in an Angular application.

#### What did you hope to gain?

I hoped to gain experience with NgRx so I could better understand the how.

#### How did it go? / What did you actually gain?

Overall it went well. I was able to get the store up and running inside an application structure we are familiar with (Core module and feature modules). Load and delete actions were implemented, along with the appropriate effects and reducers.

I would say I gained hands on experience and familiarity with NgRx workings. Up until this point I had only heard talks and podcasts on the topic so it was nice to finally implement it.

#### What are the next steps (if any)?

- Explore the NgRx <a href="https://ngrx.io/guide/schematics">schematics</a> to ease boilerplate code generation and guide NgRx standards.
- Start using in applications which could gain value from centralized state management.
